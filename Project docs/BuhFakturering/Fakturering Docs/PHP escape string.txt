1. First you will need to create a "mysqli" connection instance like:
 "$mysqli_connection = getDBConnectionInstance();" -> OBS! "getDBConnectionInstance() is my php function from lib.php"
 
2. Then do following, OBS! it will not work without passing an instance of "$mysqli_connection"
$val = $obj[$colName];
$val_ = mysqli_real_escape_string($mysqli_connection,$val);
$val__ = _numericOrString($val_);
$query .= "$colName=$val__, ";
