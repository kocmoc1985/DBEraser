TO DELETE "buh_faktura_kund" entry is not so simple, you will need to remove entries first from other tables, like the "drop sequence shows":
Also important to mention that deletion of a "buh_faktura_kund" will result into deletion of all invoices which are using this "faktura_kund"
The sequence seems to be following:
drop table buh_address; -> delete from buh_address where fakturaKundId=x
drop table buh_f_artikel; -> delete from buh_f_artikel where fakturaId=x -> so i need to get all "fakturaId" of invoices which use the  "fakturakundId" -> "select * from buh_faktura where fakturaKundId=3"
drop table buh_faktura; -> delete from buh_faktura where fakturaKundId=x
drop table buh_faktura_kund; -> delete from buh_faktura_kund where fakturaKundId=x
