- Changes to google adwords "Fakturera och skapa Offerter"
- Changes to LA site change to "Fakturera och skapa Offerter Gratis"


IMPORTANT solve the problem with not saving to desktop, and also have MAC OSX in mind *****
No iam saving to the folder of LAFakturering but the problem is that the default E-post client is not opened under MAC OSX

Update mechanism -> some essential changes could lead into the old Clien-Applications cannot work with updated Server-Side.
So the file named "version" {"version":"109"} shall also contain {"version":"109","obligatory";"0"}

Digital sign of files -> This is regarding the problem when the file is downloaded and the browser tells you that it is not safe 
Just a comment from somewhere: "The files are digitally signed with Symantec Class 3 SHA256 Code Signing CA - Microsoft Software Validation"

The settings for SMTP are saved without "_11" kundId prefix. Which makes that it loads same settings regardless of the user loged-in.

The saved user password (Java-Side) is strored in clear text in "io" folder file "pass"

Backup of all data  (have in mind that kundId could id is present in all tables)

See: what can be done regarding the Faktura content exceeds A4 *******************[2021-02-19]

SMTP Options PROBLEM -> When changing password for SMTP it must be saved before test sending a test email. [2021-06-02]

According to Lina there is also need to make possible to print out a list with fakturas which are still not payed - typ som "Kundfordringar" i SPCS

shows if faktura has "omvänd skatt" or not [2021-05-16][DONE][#INVOICE-HAS-OMVAND-SKATT#]

When user deletes an "artikel" it will delete all fakturas in which this "artikel" is used -> is it correct? (Ivan Dontu) talled me it on 2021-03-XX

It's not possible to edit rut data for an invoice and it's not even possible to replace existing RUT data when editing the invoice.
I think it makes sence to make ready the current version - without editing possibility. The editing possibility shall be made 
availble in the next version.

------------------------</URGENT>------------------------



For the "buh_faktura_artikel" -> implement so you can save moms and omvänd momssats so when you create an article those values are automatically set

For the later stage, maybe have faktura rabatt implemented -> so you can set the rabatt once for all articles in the Invoice.
