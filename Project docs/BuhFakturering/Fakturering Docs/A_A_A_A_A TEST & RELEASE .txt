Make so when you send invoice or reminder it does not contain "_1" (kundId) like "faktura_1.pdf" -> so no it is like "faktura.pdf".
OBS! Important to mention that when the file is uploaded to the php it's named like "faktura_1.pdf" -> so it's only for naming the file when it's beiing sent as attachment [100% verified]

Sanitizing input for: "_u_u_u_x_upload.php" & increasing the upload size to 1MB -> It seams that upload is rather slow... Most possible reason is the provider
