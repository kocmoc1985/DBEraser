[HOW TO DECLARE AND USE][2020-08-27]

OBS! You will need 2 files PHPMailer.php and Exception.php -> it was not working without "Exception.php"

1. Look at "index.php":
include_once ("php/PHPMailer.php");
include_once ("php/SMTP.php");
include_once ("php/Exception.php");

2. In the script you will use "PHPMailer" have this 2 lines implemented at the very top of the document, like:
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

Have a look at _http_buh.php
