[HOW TO DECLARE AND USE][2020-10-12]

OBS! You will need 3 files PHPMailer.php, SMTP.php, Exception.php -> it was not working without "Exception.php"

1. Look at "_http_buh.php", it looks like -> it's working 100% [2020-10-12]:
require 'lib.php';

use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'Exception.php';
require 'PHPMailer.php';
require 'SMTP.php';

OBS! Regarding SMTP i didn't managed to get it working with gmail. I tested many things even enabling special property
for "less secure application" from google accounts. 

With one.com it was working fine [2020-10-12]
