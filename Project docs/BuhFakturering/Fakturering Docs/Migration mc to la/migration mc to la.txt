[MAIN PROBLEMS DURING MIGRATION]

PREAMBLE: in fact the migration shall be done "automatically" which means creating the create & insert script and running
it on the new database. The **important** problem i faced was that i only executed the table create scripts but forgot to run
the table bindings/constraints which are created separetely from the table create script. So the bindings where not created and 
it caused that i was not able to execute any scripts which used the db and i thaught that something was wrong with connection to 
the mysql db.

It was a bit tricky to make "automatic" migration due to the "mixcont_com" db contained many databases which don't relate to the BuhInvoice.
So i had to copy the scripts which relates to BuhInvoice and forgot to copy the scripts related to table bindings

0. Moving the php scripts
0.2 the scripts are placed in the root dir in the "php" folder
0.3 Also created a folder named "uploads" inside the "php" folder. The "uploads" folder is needed for uploading and sending invoices 
and reminders via email. 

1. Moving DB
1.2 I moved the DB manually by creating all tables from the script and then inserting the data. Important to remember
that the insertion of data is done sequentially oposite to how the tables are dropped. So the insertion of data starts with table: "buh_kund"
1.3 Another problem i faced was that my create script was not up to date and some columns were missing.

2. Enabling FTP
2.2 Easy

3. Introducing Email: no-reply@lafakturering.se
3.2 replacing faktura@mixcont.com with no-reply@lafakturering.se

4. Java Side
4.2 Replacing the URL for calling the scripts from www.lafakturering.se instead of www.mixcont.com
4.3 So the url is: https://www.lafakturering.se/php/_http_buh.php?get_newest_version=true&json={"user";"","pass";""}
