[CHANGING ON PHP - PREVIOUS VERSIONS NOT WORKING PROPERLY] [2021-05-26]

Consider following: search for [#CRUSUAL-CHANGES-EXAMPLE-A#] in MCWebNew and in the DBEraser projects

So in the "select()" method you will see the query which looks like following:
"SELECT * FROM buh_faktura WHERE buh_faktura.kundId=%s AND fakturaId=%s" -> before the change it looked like: "SELECT * FROM buh_faktura WHERE fakturaId=%s"

So when i on [2021-05-26] added "WHERE buh_faktura.kundId=%s" on PHP side i had to make corresponding changes on java side. But the 
previous versions could not longer use the functions where such change was made.

[PHP-FUNCTIONS NAMES - HIGH RISK IF CHANGED] [2020-12-23]

In Java project consider following: DB.class -> public static final String PHP_FUNC_DEFINE_KUNDID__LOGIN = "define_kundid";

So i you will change the name -> "define_kundid" -> at Java side -> It will stop working

If you change the name -> "define_kundid" -> at PHP side and at the current Java version -> it will stop working for the clients with previois version.

[INSERT] [2020-10-28]

1. If the "insert" procedure is automatic like the "_http_buh.php->insert()" where the query is populated automatically depending on the
json string recieved ---> IT'S NOT a problem when some columns are added in case if "DEFAULT" value is specified on the level of DB.

1.2 IT'S NOT A PROBLEM if you added NEW columns to DB but didn't make changes on [JAVA] side -> in this case the "DEFAULT" values on DB level will fix this.
___

1.3 Having "insert" functions which do not populate quiries automatically may cause troubles as you must always be sure that
ammount of parameters is the same as values. Pay attention especially at those cases when such "insert" method is called from 
different locations - as it's easy to forget to make changes in all corresponding places. As the example see -> "insert_to_buh_licens_q__local()" which 
exist per [2020-10-28] and is called from 3 diff. locations.

___

2. On [2020-10-29] i added col "omvant_skatt" to table "buh_f_artikel". The previous version which didn't have this implemented 
was able to work without problems -> at least faktura creation was tested and also updating of faktura article. 
So the main idea is that adding/expanding the DB, does not influence the version which was not updated to the newest one. As i see it now, it's because
of automatic query population in the insert and update methods. The select query does not have the automatic query population, but when
the column is added it's not a problem as the new implemented field is just not included to the result. NOTE, that removing
a column will casue failure because if the column is in query but does not exist in DB it WILL CAUSE FAILURE!!  


[CASES WHEN NOTHING HAVE TO BE DONE ON PHP-SIDE]
1.  You are using the "insert()" which populates the query automatically
1.2 You added some columns to a DB table
1.3 You made corresponding changes in [JAVA]
1.4 Yes nothing has to be done at the PHP-Side
