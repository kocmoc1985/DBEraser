1. Don’t use port in the connection string
2. The host is written like 172.18.71.92\\mixcont or wtms000\\mixcont iam not sure
that it is always like that, but keep it in mind.

OBS!OBS! NOTE: Having host like this: "wtms000\\mixcont" will only work in theirs network.
To be able to connect to their database from our network have the host written like: "172.18.71.92\\mixcont"
