[ACTIVATION]
Look in "LOGIN, USER ROLES....txt" file

[COMMON JTables]
For common jtables you add it manually like:
"HelpA.setTrackingToolTip(table, q);"



[INVERT TABLES]
For the inverted tables, the tracking tooltip is added automatically on build.

NOTE That there are 2 kinds of tracking tool tip added to a invert table,
if you point on a row you will see one and also if you point on the
area some where in the corner you will see the "select" query
