
1. Create Linked servers CPRECIPE & PRODPLAN, find instruction on google drive.

2. Create Database "CPM" using CPM.sql (Don't forget to create Database "CPM" manually and then run the script CPM.sql).
	You also need to fill the CPM with data by detaching it on some Server and then attaching it.

3. Create Database "NCPD" using NCPD.sql -> OBS! you will need to execute the NCPD.sql *twice*
the first time it fails because some tables/views are created before others.

4. Add "rule" for free entrance (used by MCRecipe.jar):

insert into MCRecipeUsers values (
'rule_free_entrance',
'',
'enabled',
getDate(),
getDate()
)
