1. Create Linked servers CPRECIPE & PRODPLAN, find instruction on google drive.

2[OLD-DON'T USE]. Create Database "CPM" using CPM.sql (Don't forget to create Database "CPM" manually and then run the script CPM.sql).
You also need to fill the CPM with data by detaching it on some Server and then attaching it.
[OBS! DON'T forget to run CPM.sql script - I forgot last time 2024-03-28]

2[NEW]. Use the CPM.zip file. First attach the CPM.mdf and then create an additional Table by using the script below:
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[CASNO](
	[EC_Number] [nchar](10) NULL,
	[CAS_Number] [nchar](12) NULL,
	[ChemName] [nvarchar](max) NULL,
	[ChemNameAlt] [nvarchar](max) NULL,
	[Date_Reg] [datetime] NULL,
	[UpdatedOn] [datetime] NULL,
	[UpdatedBy] [nchar](3) NULL
) ON [PRIMARY]

3. Create Database "NCPD" using NCPD.sql -> OBS! you will need to execute the NCPD.sql *twice*
the first time it fails because some tables/views are created before others.

Also remember that some failures during creation can be "fixed" by changing "Server Objects" - "Linked Servers" - "MSDASQL" - try
to play with the settings: "Nested queries", "Level zero only", etc...

On 2024-03-28 there was an issue regarding NCPD - Programmability - Stored procedues - "dbo.prc_ITF_Recipes_Z_Z" - the
"@code_stage" parameter was missing while calling the procedure. So i have added this parameter by my own.

4. FILL THE NCPD DB: NCPD - Programmability - Stored procedues - "dbo.DELETE_CREATE_ALL_RECIPE" & "dbo.DELETE_CREATE_ALL_RECIPENew"
Per 2024-03-29 iam still not sure which of them does the job. Maybe even both.

5. In the "mccompounds.properties" file use "company=compounds" - YES THIS IS 100% verified 2024-03-28.
Otherwise the recipe initial list will not become visible even if data is available.

________________

insert into MCRecipeUsers (userName,pass,[role],dateCreated,dateChanged) values (
'sb',
'a',
'developer',
getDate(),
getDate()
)

OBS! USE ALWAYS "developer" WORKING WITH PROJECT. IT WILL SHOW TOOLTIPS AND ADDITIONAL LOG's*******
______

insert into MCRecipeUsers (userName,pass,[role],dateCreated,dateChanged) values (
'rule_free_entrance',
'',
'enabled',
getDate(),
getDate()
)

OBS! IF you use "rule_free_entrance" you will not be able to open PRODPLAN and also other settings from the HOME tab 2024-03-28

GOOD TO REMEMBER:
Procedure:  "dbo.[prc_ITF_Recipes_Z_Z ] null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null" 
is called to fill the table "ZZZ". The initial recipe-jtable which MCRECIPE shows, is showing data from the "ZZZ" table:
"select [Recipe Version],[Recipe_Additional],Descr,[Detailed_Group],Status,Class,Mixer_Code,LEFT(CONVERT(VARCHAR(19),[UpdatedOn],126),10) as [UpdatedOn],[UpdatedBy],Recipe_ID,Recipe_Origin,Loadfactor,MixTime from ZZZ"

LATEST ON 2024-03-29 i have completed all the STEPS above. I have succeeded to get the list of recipes and ingredients when opening
the MCRECIPE.
