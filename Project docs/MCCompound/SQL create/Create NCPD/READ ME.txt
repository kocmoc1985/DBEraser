1. Create Linked servers CPRECIPE & PRODPLAN, find instruction on google drive.

2[OLD-DON'T USE]. Create Database "CPM" using CPM.sql (Don't forget to create Database "CPM" manually and then run the script CPM.sql).
You also need to fill the CPM with data by detaching it on some Server and then attaching it.
[OBS! DON'T forget to run CPM.sql script - I forgot last time 2024-03-28]

2[NEW]. Use the CPM.zip file. First attach the CPM.mdf and then create an additional Table by using the script below:
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[CASNO](
	[EC_Number] [nchar](10) NULL,
	[CAS_Number] [nchar](12) NULL,
	[ChemName] [nvarchar](max) NULL,
	[ChemNameAlt] [nvarchar](max) NULL,
	[Date_Reg] [datetime] NULL,
	[UpdatedOn] [datetime] NULL,
	[UpdatedBy] [nchar](3) NULL
) ON [PRIMARY]

3. Create Database "NCPD" using NCPD.sql -> OBS! you will need to execute the NCPD.sql *twice*
the first time it fails because some tables/views are created before others.
Also remember that some failures can be "fixed" by changing "Server Objects" - "Linked Servers" - "MSDASQL" - try
to play with the settings: "Nested queries", "Level zero only", etc...

4. Add "rule" for free entrance (used by MCRecipe.jar):

insert into MCRecipeUsers (userName,pass,[role],dateCreated,dateChanged) values (
'rule_free_entrance',
'',
'enabled',
getDate(),
getDate()
)

OBS! IF you use "rule_free_entrance" you will not be able to open PRODPLAN and also other settings from the HOME tab 2024-03-28

insert into MCRecipeUsers (userName,pass,[role],dateCreated,dateChanged) values (
'a',
'a',
'admin',
getDate(),
getDate()
)

LATEST ON 2024-03-27 i have completed all the STEPS above. The tables in DB "NCPD" were created but the data was not filled.
